# hello-world
Just learning the system...
I'm currently five classes away from graduating with an Associate's Degree from my Computer Programming Tech program.  In between college classes like Visual Basic and Java, I've learned a little bit about Lua, Python, and C++ on my own.  My goal is to shift my career over to computer programming and eventually learn enough to make my own games and other software.
